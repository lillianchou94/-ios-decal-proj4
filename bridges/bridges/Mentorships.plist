		<string>The Reach and Rise mission is to help at-risk youth overcome personal, social, and family challenges through a positive adult-child relationship. Reach and Rise offers 1-to-1 mentoring to at-risk youth in San Francisco/Marin/San Mateo/Alameda counties. We help children develop tools to cope with issues such as low self-esteem, family and peer conflicts, academic underachievement, and decision-making skills. We are unique in that we provide a 15-hour paraprofessional training to all mentors before matching, which prepares them to work successfully with at-risk youth by developing relationship-building skills, exploring issues facing at-risk youth, and strategies to handle difficult situations. Thorough ongoing support is provided by the coordinator who is a Marriage and Family Therapist Intern.</string>

		<string>The Mixed Roots Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and serves as the first and only national / global multicultural foundationthat cross-sects the international, domestic, and foster care adoption experience. Our vision is to leverage philanthropy and grassroots fundraising to provide important post adoption resources for adoptees and their families.  Our mission is to promote and support organizations that serve as a resource to the diverse adoption and foster care community, create more awareness of the adoption and foster care experience, and inspire future generations of adoptees and foster youth to achieve their dreams and goals through collaboration with likeminded individuals, businesses and organizations in the greater community. The Adoptee Mentor Program (AMP), one of Mixed Roots Foundationâ€™s charter programs, sponsors youth who are adopted and/or in foster care to be matched with adult adoptee mentors that serve as positive role models that promote cultural understanding and self-acceptance of being adopted and/or in foster care as well as participate in educational and multicultural program events and activities.</string>

YES (Youth Education Scholars) to Higher Education Program was created because foster youth attend and graduate college at rates far below their peers. The objective is to increase opportunities for post-secondary education for (former) foster youth; to equip them with the tools and support to enter and succeed in school.    </string>

		<string>Letâ€™s Rise is traditionally a one-to-one mentorship program targeting underrepresented Asian/Pacific Islander youth at Helms Middle School in Richmond, CA. We bring a group of dedicated mentors from UC Berkeley to the Helms campus every Friday afternoon, where we not only provide tutoring and promote the pursuit of higher education, but also serve as emotional and psychological support systems for our mentees. Through academic enrichment, recreational bonding activities, political/community awareness workshops, and long-lasting mentor-mentee relationships, Letâ€™s Rise strives to foster confidence, leadership, empowerment and a sense of identity among the youth that we serve. We strongly hope to achieve a sense of community and family that will last long after our mentees leave the program.</string>
